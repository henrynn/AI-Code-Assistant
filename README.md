# AI Code Assistant
## AI code assistant helps developers find potential issues in programming languages, such as:

- Memory leaks
- Empty pointers
- Unclosed resources
- Infinite loops
- Unclosed Resources:
When working with input/output streams, it's important to ensure that any resources that are opened (such as InputStream or OutputStream objects) are closed when they are no longer needed. Failure to close these resources can lead to resource leaks and other issues.

Reading Large Input Streams
When reading from input streams, it's important to be aware of the size of the stream. If the stream is very large, it may not be possible to read the entire stream into memory at once without causing an OutOfMemoryError. In these cases, it's best to read the stream in smaller chunks using a buffer.

Output
If any of the mentioned issues are found, the AI code assistant will provide:

- Explanation about the issue
- Solution for the issue
- Modified code that fixes the issue
- If no issues are found, no output will be provided.
